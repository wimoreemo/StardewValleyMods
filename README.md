This repository contains all the SMAPI mods I've created for Stardew Valley. 

# General Information

1. All of the mods in this repository require SMAPI. Ensure that SMAPI is functional before mod installation.
   
3. Mods may have additional setup requirements. Read the mod description for all details. As a general rule of thumb, required frameworks are specified in the names. [CP]ExampleMod will require Content Patcher.
   
5. All mods listed are equivalently available on NexusMods. Go to the mod description to find unique mod link. Or, find the listed mods on my [NexusMods profile](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/wimoreemo/mods).
